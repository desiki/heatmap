In order to get this running you need to have nodejs installed on your machine, among other modules like express

Once the modules are installed using npm install "module_name" you need to use your google api_key and replace the text
"YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY" which is under "/views/index.html" then execute from command line:

node index.js

For checking how does it works you will need to open it in your browser as localhost:3000
